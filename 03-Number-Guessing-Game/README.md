# 🎲 Number Guessing Game (Java)

A simple console-based Java program where the computer picks a random number, and the player tries to guess it!

---

## 📖 How It Works
1. The program generates a random number between **1 and 100**.
2. The player enters guesses.
3. After each guess, the program tells the player whether the guess is:
    - Too high ⬆️
    - Too low ⬇️
    - Correct ✅
4. The game tracks the number of attempts until the player wins.
